This repo is an experiment to get aquainted with Cesium.

It is used to visualize the default local Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for the SatView object (West-North-Down) and gives a visual cue about the impact of attitude modification of the satellite via roll (rotation around +X, red axis), pitch (rotation around +Z, blue axis) and yaw (rotation around +Y, green axis).

Additionally, it shows the resulting Antenna CRS when a custom boresight is provided as Theta-Phi pointing direction.

The live demo can be accessed at [https://disberd.github.io/CesiumRotations/](https://disberd.github.io/CesiumRotations/)
